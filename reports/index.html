The reports were submitted to the California Ocean Protection Council to support the state’s resource agencies during their coastal consistency review of a federal offshore wind lease sale that was held in December 2022.\nInvasive House Mice Eradication Project “DRAFT Operatoinal Plan” (see Appendix D, page 44 of the Coastal Commission’s staff report) (2021)\nInvasive House Mice Eradication Project “DRAFT Mitigation and Monitoring Plan” (see Appendix E, page 87 of the Coastal Commission’s staff report) (2021)\nInvasive House Mice Eradication Project “DRAFT Bait Spill Contingency Plan” (see Appendix F, page 112 of the Coastal Commission’s staff report) (2021)\nInvasive House Mice Eradication Project “DRAFT Non-Target Species Contingency Plan” (see Appendix G, see page 146 of the Coastal Commission’s staff report) (2021)\nWorking closely with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff, the SeaJay team prepared the following documents: 1) Operational Plan, 2) Mitigation \u0026 Monitoring Plan, 3) Bait Spill Contingency Plan, and 4) Non-Target Species Contingency Plan. These plans had been requested by the California Coastal Commission as part of their federal consistency review of the House Mouse Eradication Project at the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge offshore San Francisco. The plans were requested to obtain the state’s concurrence of the final environmental impact statement and to assess the USFWS’s approach to mitigating any adverse effects of removing this invasive species from one of the most prolific seabird and pinniped breeding and resting areas along the West Coast.\nBiological Resources Assessment for the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club Dock Expansion Project (2015)\nSeaJay Environmental conducted an on-site and desk-top assessment of biological resources in the vicinity of the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club in Pillar Point Harbor, California, for an eventual coastal development permit related to a proposed dock expansion project.\nDraft Programmatic Environmental Assessment of Potential White Shark Research and Education Projects Within the Gulf of the Farallones and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuaries (2014)\nSeaJay Environmental prepared the draft programmatic environmental assessment for the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary’s (GFNMS) White Shark Stewardship Project to assess the effects of all existing and proposed research and ecotourism activities on white sharks in the GFNMS and Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.\nJames V. Fitzgerald Area of Special Biological Significance Pollution Reduction Program Pilot BMP Summary Report (2013)\nSeaJay Environmental assisted the San Francisco Estuary Institute in a stormwater monitoring pilot project with the County of San Mateo Department of Public Works and Parks.

Fitzgerald Area of Special Biological Significance protected area of Montara and Moss Beach, California.\nAn Assessment of the Final Rule to Implement Vessel Speed Restrictions to Reduce the Threat of Vessel Collisions with North Atlantic Right Whales (2012) National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources\nSeaJay Environmental provided database support and data analysis to the National Marine Fisheries Service that was used to assess the effectiveness of a rule that requires vessels 65 feet and greater in length to slow their speeds to 10 knots or less near key port entrances and in certain areas of North Atlantic right whale aggregation along the U.S. Eastern seaboard, known as Seasonal Management Areas.\nPrudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America’s Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources (2011) National Petroleum Council\nSeaJay Environmental provided technical and editorial support to the Operations and Environment Subgroup of the National Petroleum Council, a federal advisory committee. The study was requested by Energy Secretary Steven Chu to reassess the character and potential of North American oil and natural gas resources. and the contribution that natural gas can make in a transition to a lower carbon energy mix.\nVessel Operations in Right Whale Protection Areas (2009) National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources\nSeaJay Environmental created a SQL Server database and assisted in the data analysis to help characterize vessel traffic volume, patterns and speeds of vessels transiting Seasonal Management Areas along the Eastern seaboard. The rule was implemented for the purpose of preventing collisions between ships and the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale.\nShell Best Management Practices for Blasting and Painting Offshore Facilities (2009) Society of Petroleum Engineers\nSeaJay Environmental worked with Shell Exploration \u0026 Production engineers and operations managers to draft this paper that was presented by Shell at the Society of Petroleum Engineers conference in 2009. The paper describes best practices related to the periodical inspection and maintenance of offshore oil and gas facilities to assure structural integrity and minimize pollution and safety risks.\n","wordCount":"1014","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://seajayenv.com/reports/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SeaJay Environmental","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://seajayenv.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://seajayenv.com/ accesskey=h title="SeaJay Environmental (Alt + H)">SeaJay Environmental</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Reports</h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=reports-resulting-from-seajay-environmental-project-support>Reports resulting from SeaJay Environmental project support<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reports-resulting-from-seajay-environmental-project-support>#</a></h2><p><a href=https://www.usbr.gov/uc/progact/amp/amwg/2024-08-22-amwg-meeting/20240822-AMWGMeeting-Minutes-508-AMWQD.pdf>Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program - Minutes of the Working Group</a> (2025)</p><p><a href=https://www.usbr.gov/uc/progact/amp/twg/2023-04-13-twg-meeting/20230413-TWGMeeting-FinalMeetingMinutes-508-UCRO.pdf>Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program - Minutes of the Technical Advisory Group</a> (2023)</p><p>SeaJay Environmental provided note taking and other administrative support services to this Federal Advisory Committee of the U.S. Department of Interior&rsquo;s Bureau of Land Management, which is mandated by Congress to operate the Glen Canyon Dam and regulate the Colorado River to meet the many and varied statutory goals.
