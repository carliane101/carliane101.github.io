The drafts of these plans had been request by the California Coastal Commission as part of their federal consistency review of the House Mouse Eradication Project at the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The plans were requested to obtain the state&rsquo;s concurrence of the final environmental impact statement and to assess the USFWS&rsquo;s approach to mitigating any adverse effects of removing this invasive species from one of the most prolific seabird and pinniped breeding and resting areas along the West Coast.</p><hr><p><a href=https://smharbor.specialdistrict.org/files/3cb8f6bc3/2016_10_05_HMBYC_Dock_Expansion_Project_Biological%20Assessment_6-10-16.pdf>Biological Resources Assessment for the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club Dock

Report</a>
(2013)
San Francisco Estuary Institute</p><p>SeaJay Environmental assisted the San Francisco Estuary Institute in a
stormwater monitoring project with the County of San Mateo Department of
Public Works and Parks. The monitoring was conducted to evaluate several
types of structural stormwater treatment best management practices and low
impact development practices that the county had implemented at six
locations where stormwater discharges into the protected James V.
Fitzgerald Area of Special Biological Significance in Montara and Moss
Beach, CA.</p><hr><p><a href=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/shipstrike/assessment_nmfsopr48.pdf>An Assessment of the Final Rule to Implement Vessel Speed Restrictions to
Reduce the Threat of Vessel Collisions with North Atlantic Right
Whales</a>
(2012)
National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources</p><p>SeaJay Environmental provided database support and data analysis to the
National Marine Fisheries Service that was used to assess the effectiveness
of a rule that requires vessels 65 feet and greater in length to slow their
speeds to 10 knots or less near key port entrances and in certain areas of
North Atlantic right whale aggregation along the U.S. Eastern seaboard,
known as Seasonal Management Areas.</p><hr><p><a href=http://www.npc.org/reports/NARD/NARD_Ops-Environment.pdf>Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America’s Abundant

(2011)
National Petroleum Council</p><p>SeaJay Environmental provided technical and editorial support to the
Operations and Environment Subgroup of the National Petroleum Council, a
federal advisory committee. The study was requested by Energy Secretary
Steven Chu to reassess the character and potential of North American oil
and natural gas resources. and the contribution that natural gas can make
in a transition to a lower carbon energy mix.</p><hr><p><a href=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/shipstrike/opr44.pdf>Vessel Operations in Right Whale Protection
Areas</a>
(2009)
National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources</p><p>SeaJay Environmental created a SQL Server database and assisted in the data
analysis to help characterize vessel traffic volume, patterns and speeds of
vessels transiting Seasonal Management Areas along the Eastern seaboard.
The rule was implemented for the purpose of preventing collisions between
ships and the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale.</p><hr><p><a href=https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-121052-MS>Shell Best Management Practices for Blasting and Painting Offshore
Facilities</a>
(2009)
Society of Petroleum Engineers</p><p>SeaJay Environmental worked with Shell Exploration & Production engineers
and operations managers to draft this paper that was presented by Shell at
the Society of Petroleum Engineers conference in 2009. The paper describes
best practices related to the periodical inspection and maintenance of
offshore oil and gas facilities to assure structural integrity and minimize
pollution and safety risks.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=http://seajayenv.com/>&copy; SeaJay Environmental 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
