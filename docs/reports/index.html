<p><u>Biological Resources Assessment for the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club Dock
Expansion Project</u> (2015)</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental conducted an on-site and desk-top assessment of
biological resources in the vicinity of the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club in
Pillar Point Harbor, California, for an eventual coastal development permit
related to a dock expansion project. The report included a review of local airport
restrictions, potential impacts to the viewshed as a result of the project and
how the project could be affected in case of a tsunami.</p>

Vessel and Training Discharges in Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank
National Marine Sanctuaries</a> (2017)</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental helped in the drafting of this EA to assess the impacts of allowing the
United States Coast Guard (USCG) to continue discharging in areas within Greater Farallones and
Cordell Bank national marine sanctuaries (GFNMS and CBNMS) during routine vessel operations and
training for “live fire” and search and rescue (SAR) activities. The draft EA addressed the effects if
GFNMS and CBNMS regulations were to be amended to continue to allow these discharges.</p>

San Francisco Estuary Institute</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental assisted the San Francisco Estuary Institute in a
stormwater monitoring project with the County of San Mateo Department of
Public Works and Parks. The monitoring was conducted to evaluate several
types of structural stormwater treatment best management practices and low
impact development practices that the county had implemented at six
locations where stormwater discharges into the protected James V.

Reduce the Threat of Vessel Collisions with North Atlantic Right
Whales</a>
(2012)<br>
National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental provided database support and data analysis to the
National Marine Fisheries Service that was used to assess the effectiveness
of a rule that requires vessels 65 feet and greater in length to slow their
speeds to 10 knots or less near key port entrances and in certain areas of
North Atlantic right whale aggregation along the U.S. Eastern seaboard,
known as Seasonal Management Areas.</p>

National Petroleum Council</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental provided technical and editorial support to the
Operations and Environment Subgroup of the National Petroleum Council, a
federal advisory committee. The study was requested by Energy Secretary
Steven Chu to reassess the character and potential of North American oil
and natural gas resources. and the contribution that natural gas can make
in a transition to a lower carbon energy mix.</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental created a SQL Server database and assisted in the data
analysis to help characterize vessel traffic volume, patterns and speeds of
vessels transiting Seasonal Management Areas along the Eastern seaboard.
The rule was implemented for the purpose of preventing collisions between
ships and the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale.</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental worked with Shell Exploration &amp; Production engineers
and operations managers to draft this paper that was presented by Shell at
the Society of Petroleum Engineers conference in 2009. The paper describes
best practices related to the periodical inspection and maintenance of
offshore oil and gas facilities to assure structural integrity and minimize
pollution and safety risks.</p>
