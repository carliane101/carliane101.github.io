<p>Comprehensive technical and policy support for your company&rsquo;s energy and environmental projects</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental is a woman-owned, small business consulting firm that
specializes in analyzing energy and environmental policies, providing
regulatory compliance support, preparing environmental impact assessments,
conducting water quality monitoring, providing pollution prevention recommendations,
engaging in stakeholder support and outreach, conducting workshops and trainings, and
providing other project management support services.</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental is committed to providing clients with high quality, time sensitive and
cost-effective deliverables. We have served government agencies, non-profit
organizations and commercial entities since our founding in 2007.</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental also works with a network of environmental experts
across the sciences and engineering disciplines to meet the demands of more
complex projects while maintaining value and responsiveness to clients.
This effective operating model is very conducive to ensuring high quality,
independent experts without excessive overhead.</p>

<p>Listed below are representative projects:</p>

<h1 id="environmental-consulting">Environmental Consulting</h1>

<h2 id="fort-irwin-flora-planning-level-surveys">Fort Irwin Flora Planning Level Surveys</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental is providing safety and botanical support services to
RJRudy LLC during field surveys at the U.S. Army&rsquo;s National Training Center,
Fort Irwin, CA. The works consists of daily safety briefings followed by field surveys
conducting general flora and threatened and endangered species plant transects within 284
one-hectare plots, 11 springs, 10 playas, and approximately 30 additional
areas of interest on the base. Voucher specimens are also being collected.</p>

<h2 id="san-francisco-estuary-institute">San Francisco Estuary Institute</h2>

<p>Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental led a water quality monitoring team
in the collection of watershed samples that was part of the James V.
Fitzgerald Project Area of Special Biological Significance Pollution Reduction
Program. The data were used to evaluate differences in contaminant concentrations
from stormwater discharges into this marine reserve, which is recognized as one
of the richest, most biodiverse intertidal environments on the California coast.</p>

<h2 id="greater-farallones-national-marine-sanctuary-gfnms">Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS)</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental provided contract staff support to the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS).
Responsibilities included reviewing applications and issuing permits for proposed research, education and salvage
activities in GFNMS, as well as in the northern area of Monterey Bay National
Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). Other activities included responding to vessel grounding
incidents and overseeing the White Shark Stewardship Program. During the course of the
work, two environmental assessments (EAs) were prepared. One was a programmatic EA related to impacts
associated with white shark research and tourism. The other EA was to assess
water quality imapcts from U.S. Coast Guard live fire training discharges in GFNMS and Cordell Bank National
Marine Sanctuary. The work involved careful public records administration, such as tracking of public comments,
compiling the administrative record, and documenting all communications with stakeholders, other state
and federal agency staffs, and permit applicants. Support to GFNMS legal counsel was
also provided during several permit appeals. Other project work included assisting the GFNMS
office in its documentation of and discussions with U.S. Coast Guard to consider realigning
the commercial vessel traffic separation lanes offshore San Francisco. This effort led to
the International Maritime Organization to amend the San Francisco Traffic Separation Scheme
to enhance navigational safety and mitigate the co-occurrence of endangered marine species
with commercial vessel traffic.</p>

<h2 id="national-marine-fisheries-service-office-of-protected-resources">National Marine Fisheries Service Office of Protected Resources.</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental staff created a SQL database to support and analyze
Automatic Information System (AIS) data that were then used to assess the effectiveness
of a rule requiring vessels 65 feet and longer in length to slow their speeds to
10 knots or less near key port entrances along the U.S. Eastern seaboard and in
certain North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) aggregation sites known
as Seasonal Management Areas. Monthly reports were also sent to seventeen international
shipping companies to help them ensure compliance of United States law within their fleets.</p>

<h2 id="smithsonian-environmental-research-center">Smithsonian Environmental Research Center</h2>

<p>Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental provided dive support services
for an invasive species survey in the kelp forests between Monterey and Carmel,
California, and within the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. She identified
invasive species (primarily Watersipora) in 1-meter quadrats along 25-meter transect
lines.</p>

<h2 id="half-moon-bay-yacht-club-biological-assessment">Half Moon Bay Yacht Club Biological Assessment</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental conducted a biological assessment of the water and land
resources surrounding the Half Moon Bay Yacht Club related to a proposed
floating dock and pier for a California Coastal Development permit.</p>

<p>SeaJay Environmental is providing on-call consulting services to Shell
Exploration and Production Company. The work includes providing regulatory
support and conducting research on various topics (e.g., marine sound,
protected species, air emissions and water discharges, proposed federal regulations,
decomissioning platforms as artificial reefs, etc.) that are relevant to Shell’s
domestic offshore oil and gas activities.</p>

<h2 id="40-hour-hazardous-waste-operations-and-emergency-response-hazwoper-training">40-hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Training</h2>

<p>Carliane Johnson with SeaJay Environmental is providing on-call support to
Weber Readiness by conducting 40-hour HAZWOPER training sessions to energy and
transportation industries.</p>

<h2 id="offshore-operators-committee">Offshore Operators Committee</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental organized an industry workshop to better understand the scope of medical
evacuation assets, practices, and available procedures in federal waters
of the Gulf of Mexico. This resulted in a workshop report on best management practices and gaps.
Another workshop was organized on sandblasting and surface coating operations in the marine environment, which
was intended to obtain best management practices from offshore operators and their
contractors related to procedures used to minimize the discharge of spent
blast abrasives and paint overspray in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="walsh-perú-s-a">Walsh Perú S.A.</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental prepared a regulatory document summarizing the applicable
international legal framework pertaining to the discharge of drill cuttings
containing non-aqueous drilling residues. The document also included current research
on issues of concern related to the potential use of thermal-treatment technology to clean those cuttings.</p>

<h2 id="o-brien-s-response-management">O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Response Management</h2>

<p>SeaJay Environmental provided incident response support for the Enbridge
pipeline spill in Michigan. Evaluated proposed oil treatment options for
environmental effects on marsh and wetland habitats. Prepared standard
