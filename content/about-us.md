**SeaJay Environmental LLC** is a small, woman-owned business based in Oakland, California with more than 30 years of experience in project management and policy support to the offshore energy sector and other blue tech industries. We specialize in managing multi-agency, complex, one-off, and/or controversial projects with hand-picked teams of senior and principal-level consultants. The teams are designed specifically for your projects, which ensures the highest level of support and expert advice to meet on-time deliverables under a cost competitive business structure. 

Alternatively, as a solo environmental consultant, the firm's owner and principal environmental scientist offers a flexible alternative for certain types of projects that may not require the resources of a large consulting firm. This tends to result in faster response times and more streamlined decision-making particularly in the feasibility stages when project scopes may change frequently or for smaller-scale environmental tasks. 

Please get in touch with us to discuss your projects -- whether they require a team of experts or just one dedicated professional. It is our mission to provide seamless environmental consulting support services that will help de-risk projects. We know that quality technical work is paramount to avoiding permit/project delays and facilitating expedient reviews. 

**Core areas of work include:** 

* Analysis of state and federal regulatory and legislative initiatives 
* Permitting feasibility, strategy, and application preparation
* Fundamentals of offshore wind and ocean renewables (white papers, briefs, trainings, advisory, etc.)
* Regulatory compliance (workplace safety training and annual drills and exercises)
* Non-technical risk assessment and gaps analysis
* Preparation of environmental or biological assessments
* Agency consultations and stakeholder engagements
* Due diligence to secure financial backing
* Tracking of the administrative record including agency correspondence and community feedback
