[Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program - Minutes of the Technical Advisory Group](https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2021/12/Th11b/Th11b-12-2021-appendices.pdf) (2023)

SeaJay Environmental provided note taking and other administrative support services to this Federal Advisory Committee of the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Congress has mandated that BLM operate the Glen Canyon Dam and regulate the Colorado River to meet various statutory goals. The Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program is the forum to bring the varied interests along the Colorado River to consensus regarding the protection of downstream resources and the balancing of river operations. Members include federal cooperating agencies, Tribes, Colorado River basin states, environmental groups, recreation interests, and contractors for federal power from the Glen Canyon Dam.

[Invasive House Mice Eradication Project "DRAFT Bait Spill Contingency Plan" (see Appendix F, page 112 of the Coastal Commission's staff report)](https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2021/12/Th11b/Th11b-12-2021-appendices.pdf) (2021)

[Invasive House Mice Eradication Project "DRAFT Non-Target Species Contingency Plan" (see Appendix G, see page 147 of the Coastal Commission's staff report)](https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2021/12/Th11b/Th11b-12-2021-appendices.pdf) (2021)

Working closely with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff, the SeaJay team prepared the following documents: 1) Operational Plan, 2) Mitigation & Monitoring Plan, 3) Bait Spill Contingency Plan, and 4) Non-Target Species Contingency Plan. These plans had been requested by the California Coastal Commission as part of their federal consistency review of the House Mouse Eradication Project at the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge offshore San Francisco. The plans were needed to obtain the state's concurrence of the final environmental impact statement and to assess the USFWS's approach to mitigating any adverse effects of removing this invasive species from one of the most prolific seabird and pinniped breeding and resting areas along the West Coast.

[Environmental Assessment of Regulation of United States Coast Guard Vessel and Training Dsicharges in Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries](https://nmsfarallones.blob.core.windows.net/farallones-prod/media/docs/20180816-ea-regulation-of-uscg-discharges.pdf) (2016) 

As an embedded contractor and the acting permit corodiantor for the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS), Carliane at SeaJay Environmental worked closely with GFNMS and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) staff to prepare a draft of this environmental assessment for the regulation of U.S. Coast Guard vessel and training dsicharges in CBNMS and the newly expanded area of GFNMS. This included coordinating with Coast Guard officials to understand the scope, duration, and magnitude of the proposed live fire and search and recovery training activities in the sanctuaries. Also participated in regular calls with sanctuary staff and officials in NOAA headquaters to address inforamtion needs for the environmental assessment.

locations where stormwater discharged into the James V. 
Fitzgerald Area of Special Biological Significance protected area of Montara and Moss 
Beach, California.

[An Assessment of the Final Rule to Implement Vessel Speed Restrictions to Reduce the Threat of Vessel Collisions with North Atlantic Right Whales, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-OPR-48](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/4207)) 
(2012)

SeaJay Environmental's data synthesis was used by the National Marine Fisheries Service to assess the effectiveness of a rule that required vessels 65 feet and greater in length to slow their speeds to 10 knots or less near key port entrances and in certain areas of North Atlantic right whale aggregation along the U.S. Eastern seaboard, known as Seasonal Management Areas.

SeaJay Environmental created a SQL Server database and assisted in data processing to characterize vessel traffic volume, patterns, and speeds of vessels transiting Seasonal Management Areas along the U.S. Eastern seaboard. NMFS's Office of Protected Resources prepared the report to assess the first year of the rule's implementation and to determine its potential to prevent collisions between ships and the highly depleted North Atlantic right whale.
