<b>Come talk to us about dive support services. The following is a representative sampling of projects conducted to date:</b>

- <b>Ecology and Environment, Inc.</b> Managed the dive team tasked with 
ground-truthing marine communities (from nearshore out to 100-foot depths 
using satellite maps that provided baseline images) for a proposed 
pipeline route near Freeport Harbour, Grand Bahama Island.

- <b>Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.</b> Member of the dive team 
conducting surveys for invasive species in the kelp forests between 
Monterey and Carmel, California. Also provided support to remove the 
highly-invasive kelp, Undaria pinnatifida, from marinas in San Francisco 
and Pillar Point Harbor.

- <b>Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</b> Provided dive support to 
conduct fish and invertebrate assessments as part of the Big Sur Nearshore 
Characterization project, California.

- <b>Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.</b> Provided dive 
support for habitat characterization surveys at four new sites within the 
recently expanded part of this marine sanctuary between Point Arena and 
Gualala, California.

- <b>National Marine Fisheries Service Southwest Fisheries Science 
Center.</b> Helped to collect young-of-the-year rockfish in Monterey 
Bay.

- <b>The Woodville Karst Plain Project of the National Speleological 
Society.</b> Science and safety diver exploring submerged caves in Leon 
and Wakulla counties in North Florida, and collaborating with researchers 
to better understand the cave systems, which included installing flow 
meters, building a device for divers to collect water samples for 
uranium234/238 isotopic testing to identify source waters, and collecting 
cave crayfish for phylogenetic studies.

- <b>Florida State University Department of Oceanography.</b> Research 
assistant and safety diver under the auspices of the FSU Academic Diving 
Program in Tallahassee, Florida, for a professor and his graduate students 
investigating the distribution and responses of a benthic harpacticoid 
copepod community to natural disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico.

- <b>Shell Exploration and Production Company.</b> Consultant representing 
Shell on this Industry-Government Expedition to Flower Garden Banks 
National Marine Sanctuary and High Island 389-A platform that was being considered for partial decommissioning as an artificial reef.

- <b>Organization for Artificial Reefs.</b> Successful grant writer and team member 
conducting surveys in the northern Gulf offshore Florida to 
locate suitable sites for constructing reefs, mapping the reefs after 
deployment, and monitoring new reefs to determine the progress of marine 
life accumulating on these structures.
